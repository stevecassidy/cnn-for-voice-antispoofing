# Baseline system

This is tensorflow code for training 3CNN+2FC model.

# Setting the Python environment

1. Download and installing conda.
download url: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/

bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

2. Create virtual environment for python using conda.
./miniconda2/bin/conda create -n hb_book
source activate hb_book
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.4.1

# Feature extraction process

This version of feature extraction process use Matlab scripts to compute spectrogram.
```bash
matlab -r "run_normallogpow"
```
# Information regarding model training

Tensorflow is used to implement the deep architectures. Require tensorflow (>=1.4.0) with GPU support.
``bash
python cnn_128.py 0.01
```

# Scoring

Require Matlab and bosaris toolkit: https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/
```bash
./scoring1.sh
```
