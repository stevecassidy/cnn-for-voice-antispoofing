This folder contains Matlab scripts to use AlexNet as a feature extractor and to perfom transfer learning. 

# Software requirements

1. Matlab 2017b, it requires Signal processing toolkit, Neural Network Toolbox Model for AlexNet Network support package.
2. requires GPU support (only for transfer learning).
3. Bosaris toolkit for computing EER. https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/

# Feature extraction

1. Setup the ASVspoof 2017 database, by creating symbolic links
ln -s /database/ASVspoof2017/train/wav ASVspoof2017_train
ln -s /database/ASVspoof2017/dev/wav ASVspoof2017_dev
ln -s /database/ASVspoof2017/eval/wav ASVspoof2017_eval

the dir location is fixed in run_all_train.m, run_all_dev.m, and run_all_eval.m for training, development, and evaluation dir location, respectively.

This will extract features for train, dev, and eval sets.
In bash, using command line:
```
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -r "feat_extract"
```

# AlexNet (as a feature extractor), SVM
```
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -r "script_directSVM"
```

# AlexNet + transfer learning
```
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -r "script_transferLearning"
```
